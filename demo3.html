<p>
 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that has been spreading worldwide since late 2019 has sickened millions of people, shut down major cities, prompted unprecedented global travel restrictions, and influenced the global spread of misinformation and panic.
CDDEP is committed to sharing evidence-based research and recommendations to the public in India and around the world in an effort to help curb the spread of the novel virus.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.

The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.

Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the illness.
